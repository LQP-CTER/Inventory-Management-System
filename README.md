# Inventory Management System

This project is an Inventory Management System built using Python with a Tkinter GUI, SQLite for database management, and SQLAlchemy for ORM-based interactions with the database.

## Project Structure

- **Userlogin.py**: Contains the login functionality with a graphical interface for the user to input their username and password. It includes validation against a SQLite database to check user credentials.
- **Addtional_features.py**: Contains custom `myentry` and `mycombobox` classes for autocompletion features for entry and combobox widgets.
- **Admin_menu.py**: Implements the administrative features, including stock management, viewing the dashboard, and managing inventory transactions.
- **inventory_management.py**: Defines the database models and ORM classes, including `Inventory`, `InventoryTransaction`, `InventoryBalance`, and `Employee` using SQLAlchemy.
- **main.py**: Main entry point for the application that integrates the login, admin, and user menus, based on the user’s account type.
- **User_menu.py**: Contains user-specific menu features such as viewing and managing inbound and outbound stock.

## Features

### User Interface (GUI)
- **Login Window**: Users can log in with their credentials.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A dashboard to view and manage inventory, including stock levels, transactions, and reports.
- **User Menu**: Users can perform actions like viewing inventory, inbound and outbound stock, and manage transactions.
- **Inventory Management**: Admins can add, update, and manage inventory data and perform inbound and outbound stock operations.

### Database
- SQLite is used to store all inventory data, including product details, stock levels, transaction records, and employee information.
- SQLAlchemy ORM is used for database interactions, making it easier to manage database records.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install the necessary Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure that you have the required database schema in place (SQLite). You can modify the paths in the code as needed.

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Login**: Enter a valid username and password to log into the system. If the credentials are correct, the user will be directed to the main menu based on their account type (Admin or User).
2. **Admin Menu**: The admin can view the dashboard, manage inventory, perform stock transactions (inbound, outbound, transfer), and more.
3. **User Menu**: Users can perform actions like viewing the inventory and managing inbound and outbound stock.

## Database Schema

The project uses the following main tables:
- **Users**: Stores user credentials and account types.
- **Inventory**: Stores product information.
- **InventoryTransaction**: Records stock transactions such as inbound and outbound.
- **InventoryBalance**: Tracks stock levels for each product in different warehouses.
- **Employees**: Stores employee details.
- **Warehouses**: Details of different warehouses.
